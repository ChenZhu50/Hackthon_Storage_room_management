# SustainableShare

SustainableShare is a centralized platform that enables university clubs to manage their inventory, share surplus materials with other organizations, and reduce waste. It promotes sustainability, minimizes unnecessary spending, and cuts down on carbon emissions from constant reordering and shipping.

## Problem

University clubs often face issues with leftover event materials taking up dorm space, over-purchasing items, limited funding, and delays in procurement. This leads to unused inventory and inefficiencies in resource management.

## Solution

SustainableShare allows clubs to register, track inventory, and share surplus items. Clubs can create listings for surplus materials, submit requests for items, and arrange handoffs directly with other clubs.

## Features

* Club registration and organization management
* Inventory tracking with listings including title, quantity, and description
* Viewing active listings on the home page
* Viewing individual clubs' listings
* Submitting request forms for specific quantities of items
* Managing requests for listings and arranging handoffs
* Optional participation in asset sharing without accepting requests

## How It Works

1. Clubs register their organizations on the platform.
2. They add listings for surplus items with title, quantity, and description.
3. All active listings are displayed on the home page, and users can view listings from individual clubs.
4. Interested clubs submit a request form specifying the desired quantity.
5. Listing clubs view incoming requests and can contact requesting organizations to arrange a handoff.
6. Clubs may choose not to accept requests and use the platform solely for inventory management.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
* **Backend**: Node.js, Express, and TypeScript
* **Database**: MongoDB

## Challenges

* Image uploads for listings were planned but not implemented due to time constraints.
* Ensuring scalability to handle multiple clubs, requests, and interactions.
* Managing Git merge conflicts with a large team working in parallel.

## Accomplishments

* Built a fully functional platform from scratch in a limited timeframe.
* Prioritized user experience with a visually appealing, intuitive, and easy-to-navigate interface.
* Effective team collaboration to overcome technical hurdles.

## What We Learned

* The importance of teamwork in balancing tasks and skill sets.
* Efficient coordination and support among team members.
* Hands-on experience with new libraries and frameworks for styling and usability.

## Future Plans

* Implement image uploads to enhance listing quality.
* Enhance security and access controls.
* Refine public/private listing functionality.
* Partner with student governments (e.g., SBU USG) to expand to other universities for national sustainability initiatives.
